K-Dual is a project created as part of the **Tech4Impact program created by KAIST and Kakao Impact.** With the aim of solving social problems through technology, social innovators and KAIST students worked together on the project, and we cooperated with the Korea Society of Type 1 Diabetes.

There is a demand to manage both people's blood sugar levels at once, but we found out that there is no Wear OS app that provides that functionality. Thus we developed an app for smart watches that can conveniently monitor blood sugar levels of two people.

K-Dual helps you manage health of two people on your wrist conveniently at a glance. We hope our small invention can be an opportunity to deliver the convenience of technology.
